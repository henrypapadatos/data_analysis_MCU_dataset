          <h2>Why this matters</h2>
          <p>
            Television and especially films play a crucial role in our modern society. The main
             characters in films serve as role models and inspire the younger generation, who may
             spend up to 78,000 hours watching television in their lifetime, as a <a href="https://studyfinds.org/survey-the-average-adult-will-watch-more-than-78000-hours-of-tv/">survey</a> of 2,000
             British adults has shown.<br>
             Furthermore, the growing public interest in the issue of representativeness has led us
             to study it through the cinema, believing that it plays a crucial role in achieving a
             more inclusive society.<br>
             To do this, we use a large database of films, and construct two indicators to measure
             gender and ethnic representation within a film. We then look at the evolution of the
             latter over time, across the main film genres, as well as across the different countries
             of the world. Finally, we will try to show how representativeness is perceived by the
             general public, by analysing the reviews and the box-office revenues of films.

          <h2>Research questions</h2>
          <p>
            We focus our analysis on two main interrogations :
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt>How is representativity distributed across cinematography genre, countries of production and time ?</dt>
            <dd>The theme of representativeness has become increasingly important in the public sphere in recent years,
                but can this trend be seen in film? Are there regional anomalies? Are there discrepancies between film 
                genres? We will try to answer these questions. In this section we will take a descriptive approach in 
                order to highlight the different aspects of representativeness in the cinema.</dd>

            <dt>How does representativity impact a movie’s critical and commercial success?</dt>
            <dd>Our first question looks at differences in representation within the film industry, but how are they perceived?
                Do they affect public opinion? Does this affect the box-office scores of the films? These are the questions we
                will try to answer in this second part. With an analytical approach this time, we will try to measure the impact
                that representativeness can have on the cinema and on the public.</dd>

            To conduct our analysis, we used the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/">CMU Movie Summary Corpus</a>.
            This is a huge dataset with information on more than 80'000 films, 450'000 characters and more than 40'000 summaries.
            We will guide you through the type of information available and all the manipulations we have done using the Christmas
            classic <i>Love Actually</i> as an example. The dataset is separated in three categories:

            <dt>Movies metadata</dt>
            <dd>
              A table with general information about the films. Moreover, it contains <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190588">wikidata identifiers</a>, which allowed us to 
              enrich the data with an additional entry: <i>The Rotten Tomato score</i>. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> is an American website that gathers
              professional reviews of a film, then classifies them between fresh and rotten. The Tomatometer is then the <i>freshness</i>
              attributed to the film. In order to ensure that we had enough data to carry out an analysis, we also collected the
              number of reviews made.

              A table with different attributes about the actors and their film characters. However, the ethnicities given for the

          <h2>Metrics</h2>
          <p>To answer our research questions, we first need to have a way to quantify the 
            diversity in movies. For this purpose we created some custom metrics :

            <dd>
              The first thing we needed to measure ethnic and gender diversity was to be able to quantify the importance
              of the role played by an actor. Do they play a leading role, or is it only a minor role? To do this, we
              analysed the summary of the film and awarded points each time a character was mentioned, and proportionally 
              to the order of appearance. In addition, we used the natural language processing tool <a href="https://spacy.io/universe/project/neuralcoref">neuralcoref</a>
               based on <a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> to analyse the summaries, find the character's
              co-references and replace them with their names, as highlighted in the example below.<br>

          <h2>How is representativity distributed across cinematography genre, countries of production and time?</h2>
          <h4>Release date's influence</h4>
          <p>
            We are first interested at how the scores evolved through time. The average values of the gender diversity metric and ethnicity
            diversity metric are displayed in the graph below.<br> Two trends can be seen to emerge. On the one hand, ethnic diversity
            seems to be decreasing slightly or maybe even stabilising over the years, while on the other hand, we can clearly see
            the diversity of the genre increasing, having almost tripled in less than a century.<br> An attempt can be made to explain
            some of the decline in ethnic diversity by the growth of Indian cinema with the rise of Bollywood in particular and the
            resulting large increase in actors of South Asian ethnicity. This cinema is naturally at a disadvantage in terms of
            ethnic representation because it has only one predominant ethnicity, unlike American cinema, which can have two: North
            American and African-American. In addition, Indian cinema has a large number of actors, thus it does not represent a
            minority and therefore makes especially few points.<br>
            On the contrary, we did not find an obvious explanation for the increase in gender diversity, so this would rather
            suggest a societal change, which is good news for the representation of diversity. Later we shall try to measure
            if this effect is visible in commercial or critical success of a movie.

          <p>
            To visualise the evolution of the different genres of films produced, the ethnicity of the actors involved and the main countries
            of production over time, we have created the interactive graph below. By double clicking on the title of a data item, it is
            possible to select it in order to better visualise its evolution over time. Also it is normalised to see the percentage
            distribution of our data. <br> This graph represents the evolution of world cinema, with all the biases associated with the method and
            completeness with which the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/">CMU Movie Summary Corpus</a> data was collected. The
            emergence of Bollywood cinema, and the associated growth in the number of South Asian actors, can easlily be observed, as well as
            the decline of black and white films. Interestingly enough, one can see the golden age of Italian cinema in the mid sixties where at
            its peak it represented 25% of the world film production.

          </div>
          

          <div class="section-title">
            <h4>Country of origin's influence</h4>
            <p> 
              We were then interested to see if some country typically produced more diverse movies. The plot below shows
              for each country (when available) the average scores of movies produced by said nation. The dropdown menu allows
              to select between gender diversity score and ethnicity diversity score.<br>
              Regarding ethnic diversity, there are no big surprises or particularly interesting discrepancies. Countries
              (or rather continents) with a minor film industry naturally produce fewer actors, and therefore represent minorities
              on screen. Hence, they naturally obtain better results. The case of India is a small exception, with a particularly
              low score.<br> 
              Similarly, there is no particular discrepancy regarding the representativeness of the genre with the exception of
              the Iran-Pakistan-India area. An area that is not usually known for its gender equality, it is therefore particularly
              surprising that it scores so well in terms of gender representation, almost 25% higher than the US. <br>
              Note however that we only measure the importance of gender on screen in terms of visibility, and do not do further analysis 
              on potential stereotypes that may exist.<br>

            <h4>Movie genre's impact</h4>
            <p> 
              Finally, we looked at the distribution of the two scores among the main film genres. In order to have
              a meaningful comparison, we considered only the 12 most common types of films in the dataset.<br>
              Firstly, we notice that the category with the highest genre diversity scores is romance films. This
              is easily explained as most films in this genre have a male and a female lead. Then, unsurprisingly, one
              of the worst scores is for the category of black and white films. This is a category of film that has
              disappeared over time, while the average representation of the genre has increased.  On the other hand,
              it is more worrying that action films, short films and documentaries are the worst performers. When the
              number of actors is low or when there are heroes, it is regrettable to see that it is always men who are highlighted.<br>
              Regarding ethnic diversity, the metric is relatively well distributed across genres, with some interesting points.
              On the one hand, it is curious to see that black and white films, which had a very poor representation of the
              genre, are exemplary this time. Equally curious, but regrettable this time, is that the World Cinema category
              has the worst score, without us being able to provide a convincing explanation.

          <h2>How does representativity impact a movie’s critical and commercial success?</h2>
          <p>
            In order to do the following analysis, we will use two additional features : the Rotten Tomatoes scores and the box office revenue. 
            <br>The Rotten Tomatoes scores represent the success of the movies among critics. Whereas, the box office revenue represents the commercial success.
            <br><br>
            We will conduct an observational study to understand if the representativity in movies influences their success. 
             <br>
            The goal of the observational study is to eliminate all the elements that could influence the success of movies except the one we're interseted in :
            representativity of course. These parasitic elements are called cofounders and the method to remove them is called matching.
            In our case, we will remove the following cofounders: the country of production of a movie, the year of the production and the genre of the movie.
              <br>
            Once the cofounders are eliminated, we will finally be able to know if diversity in movies influence their success. 
          </p>

          <br>

          <h4> The effect of representativity</h4>
          <p>
          In this first part, we'll use exact matching : a movie with low diversity and a movie with high diversity are matched if they have exactly the same genre, 
          country of production and year of production, in order to make an unbiased comparison.
          <br><br>
          The left-side graph shows the impact of diversity on the Rotten Tomatoes score, which represents the film's critical reviews. It can be seen that on average
          films with greater diversity are more successful, with for example an average of 4 points more on reviews of films with high ethnic diversity. However, it 
          is important to note that this effect is not statistically significant, as the uncertainties are far too great.<br>
          The right-hand chart illustrates the impact of diversity on box-office revenues. This time the trend is clearer and the uncertainties lower. There is even
          a statistically significant difference for the impact of gender diversity, suggesting that film with higher gender diversity are indeed more successful,
          at least in term of commercial success. 
          <br><br>

            <h4>Time evolution of the effet of representativity</h4>
            <p>
              We now want to analyze if the influence of representativity in the success of movies evolves with time. In order to do so, we need to consider
              movies year by year. Therefore, we manipulate less data at once. As we can not afford to loose much data points, we will use propensity score
              matching. It is a more complex but less strict method than exact matching.<br>
              <br>
              The graph below shows the evolution of the difference in Rotten Tomatoes score between films with high diversity versus films with low
              diversity. The scale is directly the number of additional percent obtained by movies with higher diversity.
              One can observe that there is no clear trend of a potential effect of ethnic or gender diversity on the film reviews given by the Rotten Tomatoes score.
              We see fluctuations from year to year, linked to the limited number of films available, while the average seems to remain stable
              around zero.<br> We can see that the effect on ethnic diversity this time is slightly below zero, which contrasts with our previous
              results. We explain this slight difference by the method of matching (propensity and no longer exact) which has changed. In any
              case, the effect is not statistically significant enough for us to conclude that the effect is indeed present.<br>
            </p>
            <div class="col-">  
              <iframe id="serviceFrameSend" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="assets/plots/temporal_obsstudy_rotten.html" height="525" width="80%"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
              The graph below represents the difference in the average log revenue of high diversity films compared to low diversity films. For example, a difference
              of 0.3 means that films with high diversity, on average, earned about 3 million dollars more in revenue.<br> 
              Despite the annual differences, it can be seen that there is no significant change in the effects over the twenty years considered. On the other hand,
              although there is no trend, we observe that the average is systematically higher than zero, which supports our previous analysis suggesting the presence
              of a diversity effect on the commercial success of a film.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Through this project, we explored the influence of gender and ethnic diversity in the movie industry. To this end, we built two metrics: the gender diversity metric and the ethnicity diversity metric. We then answered two broad research questions:
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt>How is representativity distributed across cinematography genre, countries of production and time ?</dt>
            <dd>The most interesting result we obtained when answering this question is the time evolution of the representativity. 
              Indeed, in the last 50 years, the average gender representativity has been multiplied by 3 ! It was an interesting yet pleasing discovery, even though the way to equity is still long.  On the other hand, the ethnicity score has slightly reduced over the same time window. 
              </dd>

            <dt>How does representativity impact a movie’s critical and commercial success?</dt>
            <dd>All our results were in the encouraging direction of a more diverse and equitable cinema, although the only statistically significant result we obtained is the impact of gender diversity on box office revenue.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>These two results combined give us some very interesting insights. <br>
            As we said, the success of movies is more impacted by gender diversity than it is by ethnicity diversity. We also observed that only the gender score increases over time. 
            This is good news for gender diversity! There is still plenty of work to be done because we're still far from the objective, but we are going in the right direction. 
            On the contrary, our results show that the problem of the lack of ethnicity diversity is not yet ready to be solved in the cinema industry.
